All of the OSCI partners are already working on new catalogues, some of which provide new challenges in presentation of information and the creation of templates.

- The Art Institute of Chicago has already released online collection catalogues on the paintings and drawings of [Caillebotte](https://publications.artic.edu/caillebotte/reader/paintingsanddrawings) and [Pisarro](https://publications.artic.edu/pissarro/reader/paintingsandpaper), and has used the [OSCI Toolkit](http://www.oscitoolkit.org) technology to produce two exhibition catalogues and in-gallery interpretive kiosks. An additional nine catalogues are in production, including five devoted to individual nineteenth- and early twentieth-century artists, one on Indian art of the Americas, and one on Roman sculpture.
- Subsequent to the OSCI initiative, Tate published [*Henry Moore: Sculptural Process and Public Identity*](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/henry-moore) (2015), [*The Art of the Sublime*](http://www.tate.org.uk/art/research-publications/the-sublime) (2013), and part of its J.M.W. Turner collection of sketchbooks, drawings, and watercolors, and is continuing to add to its Turner catalogue.  
- The Freer and Sackler Galleries are committed to the production of two additional catalogues on Korean Goryeo paintings and Chinese jades.
- LACMA is in production on an online publication for the Carter Collection of Dutch Paintings.
- The National Gallery has released its second online catalogue, [*Italian Paintings of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries*](http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/research/online-editions/italian-paintings-of-the-thirteenth-and-fourteenth-centuries.html) by Miklós Boskovits, and is currently in production on three other digital publications: *American Modernism, Nineteenth-Century French Painting (Van Gogh and Gaugin)*, and *Sixteenth-Century Italian Painting (Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese)*. Several others are slated for production in the years ahead.
- SFMOMA received a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to investigate and publish five areas of the collection, working in conjunction with the artists themselves: photography in the 1970s, Bay Area high-tech design, and the work of artists Ellsworth Kelly, Vija Celmins, and Julia Scher. These investigations will be published using the tools developed during the OSCI project.
- SAM plans to produce an online catalogue for its collection of Japanese paintings.
- The Walker Art Center is developing content on interdisciplinary artists to add to its Living Collections Catalogue, and also plans to add new volumes for upcoming collections-based exhibitions.

While it remains to be seen how many other museums will take up one of the OSCI approaches, momentum is building for the publication of permanent collection catalogues online. In addition to the museums participating in OSCI, the Indianapolis Museum of Art and the Dallas Museum of Art have used the [OSCI Toolkit](http://www.oscitoolkit.org) to publish scholarly presentations of their collections to the Web, and other museums are examining options for online publication.
